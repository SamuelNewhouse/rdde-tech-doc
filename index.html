			<p>This document explains how to implement responsive diagonally distributed elements using JavaScript.
				To simplify things, <a href="https://github.com/sdecima/javascript-detect-element-resize">Detect Element Resize
				by Sebastian Decima</a> will be used to detect any resize on elements containing elements to be distributed. After finishing,
				you will have a replica of <a href="">Responsive Diagonally Distributed Elements by Samuel Newhouse</a> created from the ground-up
				with an understanding of how it works.</p>
			<p>This implementaion relies on setting class names on a container element containing the elements to be
				diagonally distributed. The class names will set the rules for:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>The angle of distribution (diagonally down or up)</li>
					<li>The basis for alignment (left or right margin)</li>
					<li>Blocking or not blocking elements from crossing the basis margin.</li>
				</ol>
			<p>More options could be added to increase sophistication, but these three offer a solid starting point for understanding
				some of the complicating factors to consider when trying to create RDDE.
